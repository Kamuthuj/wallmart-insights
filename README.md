I utilized a Kaggle data set containing sales data from a walmart store. I then created a relational database for the same where I loaded all the data from the CSV file. I used different SQL scripts to perform analysis on sales,store performance,produts and profits.
I also performed analysis on the different customers to see how they purchase products.
